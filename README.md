# Benchmarking Deep Learning Models for Lesion Segmentation (2022)

Selecting an appropriate deep learning model for lesion segmentation can be challenging, especially given the diverse types of medical images and varying user requirements (e.g., efficiency, performance, memory capacity, or training time). 

In this study, we benchmarked nine deep learning models on six different medical datasets to address these challenges.

# Experiments
## Data Preprocessing
All images were resized to **224Ã—224** for uniformity. 
All datasets, except the ISIC-2017, were split into train, validation, and test sets with a **6:2:2** ratio.

| Kvasir-SEG                           | 600       | 200            | 200      |

| Breast Ultrasound (Malignant Tumors) | 126       | 42             | 42       |

## Evaluation Metrics
1. **Dice Score**: Measures overlap between predicted and ground truth masks.

$$ Dice Score = \frac{2 \times |Y \cap Y_{pred}|}{|Y \cup Y_{pred}|} $$

2. **DiceBCELoss**: Combines Dice loss and Binary Cross Entropy.

$$ Dice BCELoss = (1 - Dice Score) + Binary Cross Entropy $$

## Training Configuration
- **Framework**: PyTorch  
- **Batch Size**: 8  
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-4  
- **Weight Decay**: 1e-8  
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Epochs**: 100 (with early stopping after 20 epochs without validation improvement)

### Insights
1. **FCBFormer** achieved the highest average Dice score across datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for lesion segmentation.  
2. Lightweight models like **ESFPNet-L** performed exceptionally well on polyp segmentation datasets (Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB).  
3. Traditional models (e.g. UNet, UNet++) showed lower performance compared to modern transformer-based architectures.
